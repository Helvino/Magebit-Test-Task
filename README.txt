Unfortunately, due to my own time constraints, I couldn't finish the 3rd Task about PHP/MySQL. :(
To show that I have atleast some knowledge about this subject, a couple of weeks ago I wrote a simple ToDo list with table row addition,
removal, editing etc. It is available as a repository un my github profile, here's the link:

https://github.com/Helvino/ToDoList

Hopefully, it will give some insight in my abilities.

Thank you in advance.
